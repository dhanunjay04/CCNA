# Understanding WAN Technologies

## Introducing WANs
A WAN is a data communications network that operates beyone the geographic scope of a LAN

There major characteristics of WANs:
  * WANs connect devices that are located over wide geographic areas
  * WANs use these services of carriers such as telephone companies, cable companies, satellite systems, and network providers
  * WANs use various connection types to provide access to bandwitch over large geographical areas

## WANs vs LANs
  * WANs are different from LANs in several ways. The most significant differences are geographical area and ownership. A LAN connects computers, peripherals, and other devies ina  single building or other small geographical area. A WAN allows the trasmission of data across borad distances.

## WAN Devices
There are several devies that operate at the physical layer in a WAN.
  * Routers
  * CSU/DSU
  * WAN switches
  * Core routers
  * Modems

**CSU/DSU:** Digital lines, such as T1 or T3 carrier lines, require a CSU and a DSU The two are often combined into a single piece of equipment that is called the CSU/DSU. The CSU provides termination for the digital signal and ensures connection integrity through error correction and line monitoring. The DSU converts the T-carrier line frames into frames that the LAN can interpret and vice versa
**Modem:** A Modem modulates an analog carrier signal to encode digital information and also demodulates the carrier signal to decode the transmitted information
**WAN Switch:** A WAN switch is a multiport internetworking device that is used in carrier networks
**Router:** A router provides internetworking and WAN access interface ports that are used to connect to the service provider network
**Core Router:** A core router resides within the middle or backbone of the WAN, rather than at its periphery.
