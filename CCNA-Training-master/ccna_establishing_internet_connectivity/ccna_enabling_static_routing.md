# Enabling Static Routing

## Routing Operations
This topic describes basic static and dynamic routing operations
  * Path identification and selection
    - Discovers possible routes to the intended destination
    - Selects the best route
    - Maintains and verifies the routing information
  * Packet forwarding
    - Router identifies the destination address

## Static and Dynamic Routing Comparison
Static routes:
  * A network admin manually enters static routes into the router
  * A network topology change requires a manual update to the route
  * Routing behavior can be precisely controlled

Dynamic routes:
  * A network routing protocol automatically adjusts dynamic routes when the topology or traffic changes
  * Router learn and maintain routes to the remote destinations by exchanging routing updates
  * Rotuers discover new networks by sharing routing table information
