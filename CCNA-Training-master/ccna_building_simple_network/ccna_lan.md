# Local Area Networks
A LAN is a network for computers and other compents that are located relatively close together in a limited area.

## Need for Switches
  * Operate at the link layer of the TCP/IP protocol suite
  * Forward, filter, or flood frames based on the MAC table entries

### Duplex
In a **full duplex** system, both parties can communicate with each otehr simultaneously
In a **half duplex** ssytem, there are still two clearly defined paths/channels, and each part can communicate with the other but not simultaneously; the communication is one direction at a time.

## Switches
LAN switch characteristics
  * High port density
  * Large frame buffers
  * Mixture of port speeds
  * Fast internal switching
  * Low per-port cost

### VLAN
A virtual LAN (**VLAN**) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2). LAN is an abbreviation of local area network. To subdivide a network into virtual LANs, one configures a network switch or router.

### ARP
The **address resolution protocol (arp)** is a protocol used by the Internet Protocol (IP) [RFC826], specifically IPv4, to map IP network addresses to the hardware addresses used by a data link protocol. The protocol operates below the network layer as a part of the interface between the OSI network and OSI link layer.
