# Building a Simple Network

### Dynamic Ports
  * Dynamic Desirable
  * Dynamic Auto

### Trunking
In Cisco networks, **trunking** is a special funtion that can be assigned to a port, making that port capable of carrying traffic for any or all of the VLANs accessible by a particular switch

### Spanning Tree
The **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** is a netowrk protocol that builds a logical loop-free topology for Ethernet networks. The basic function of STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them.

## Types of Applications
### Batch Application
  * FTP, SFTP, health status
  * No direct human interaction
  * Bandwidth important
### Interactive Applications
  * Inventory inquiry, database updates
  * Human Interaction
  * Response time important, but not critical
### Real-Time Application
  * VoIP, video
  * Human-to-Human interaction
  * End-to-End latency critical

## Characteristics of a Network
  * Topology
  * Speed
  * Cost
  * Security
  * Availability
  * Scalability
  * Reliability

## Physical Topologies
  * Bus Topology
  * Star Topolgy
  * Mesh Topology
