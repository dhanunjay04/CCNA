# Multiarea OSPF IPv4 Implementation

## Single-Area vs. Multiarea OSPF
Single-area OSPF
  * Many LSAs proceed on every router
  * Large routing tables

Multiarea OSPF
  * LSA processing confined to an area
  * Smaller routing tables summarization is used

## Planning for Implementation of OSPF
  * Access the requirement and options
    - Verify IP addressing
    - Verify network topology
  * Define ABRs and ASBRs
  * Create  an implementation plan
  * Configure OSPF
