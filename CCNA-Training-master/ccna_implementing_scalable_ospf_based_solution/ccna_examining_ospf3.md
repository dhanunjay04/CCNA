# Examining OSPFv3

##  OSPFv3 Key Characteristics
  * OSPFv3 is an implementation of the OSPF routing protocol for IPv6
  * OSPFv2 (for IPv4) and OSPFv3 (for IPv6) run independently on the router
  * OSPFv3 has the same key capabilities as OSPFv2 for IPv4 networks
    - Mutliarea network design with ABRs that segment the network
    - SPF algorithm for optimal path calculation

The OSPFv3 metric is still based on interface costing
